This project does not use opencv.
OpenCV in ubuntu if already installed may be linked to a project. 
Its maven dependencies are missing because it is a C++ project. However, if you are able to build it on your machine,
or have installed its binaries from synaptic, you can link it. You need to search for a opencv248.jar (or similar)
 on your machine which should be installed as a user library in eclipse's project properties.
Also that user library needs to link to native library location on your machine. This should contain all the opencv 
shared library files (so files) (I found it in /usr/lib/jni).
